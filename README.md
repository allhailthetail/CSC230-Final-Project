# CSC230-Final-Project
Final Project for my Rize Intro to Web Development Course

## Web Site's Purpose:
Being a student is hard, but finding the resources you need to be successful doesn't have to be. <br>
The goal of this project is to exhibit my vision for a student-centric landingpage on for a mock institution: <br>
*Metropolitan Rural College (MRC)*. <br>

Rather than hide pertinent information accross department sub-domains, as is the norm, *MRC's* tech staff has thoughtfully <br>
centralized a curated list of helpful links and tools for their various majors.

MRC wants its students focused on studies, so their student portal features a clean UI that's easy to navigate and includes <br>
a [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to encourage responsible time management. This, in additon to <br>
the university's insistence on semantic HTML, is part of their plan to ensure they maintain an inclusive environment for <br>
students of all backgrounds and circumstances.

Luckily, MRC employs the best web developers, which had the idea to integrate several API tools to make the site maximally awesome. <br>
Firstly, they used JavaScript to inject inspiring quotes of the day to the homepage and the sub-page **footers**, which adapt depending on what <br>
page is being viewed (general to subject-specific). Finally, *Metropolitan Rural College* takes their extracirriculars very seriously. <br>
So, at the athletic director's insistence, a minimalistic tile was added to the homepage that displays the current weather conditions and those for the next 24 hrs.
